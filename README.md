# SDM C libraries

When writing C, I find myself reimplementing the same things over and over again.  Reading entire files, string-views, dynamic arrays, etc.

The intention of this library is to combine all of these things into a single library.  In the future I might smoosh it into a single header file, turning it into an STB style thing.  Not sure yet.

## Quick start

The following will compile and run the `test.c` file, which shows off (and tests) most of the functionality.

```console
$ make run
```
